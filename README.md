# RS School Virtual Keyboard Task solution

## 1. About

This app was created as [RS School](https://rs.school/) Javascript / Front-end Mentoring Program in Lithuania & Latvia 2022Q3 Course [Virtual Keyboard Task](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/virtual-keyboard/virtual-keyboard-lt.md) solution.
The main point of the task is to create fully functional virtual keyboard responding to physical keyboard and mouse key presses and outputting text. Virtual keyboard supports two languages: English and Lithuanian.

Created on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04). Tested on Chrome v109.0, Firefox v109.0 (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10) and Safari v12.1 (macOS). Use this app on screens with at least 680px width for best experience (responsiveness wasn't one of the main points of the task).
